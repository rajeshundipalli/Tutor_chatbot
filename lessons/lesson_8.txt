### Object-Oriented Programming

- Classes and Objects: Define classes using the class keyword and create objects as instances of classes.
- Inheritance: Derive new classes from existing classes using inheritance.
- Polymorphism: Use methods in different ways through method overriding and overloading.
- Encapsulation: Restrict access to methods and variables using private and public access specifiers.
