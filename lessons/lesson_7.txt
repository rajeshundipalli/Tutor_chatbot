### Exception Handling

- Understanding Exceptions: Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program.
- Try, Except, Finally: Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions and finally to execute code regardless of an exception.
- Creating Custom Exceptions: Define custom exceptions by inheriting from the Exception class.
